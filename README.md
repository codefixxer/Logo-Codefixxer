# Codefixxer — Logo & Brand Package

**Status:** Delivered (vector master + exports)  
**Designer:** Professional graphic designer (commissioned by the client)  
**Purpose:** Repository of the Codefixxer master logo files and export assets for web, product UI, marketing and print use.

---

## Project Context
Codefixxer is a multi-tenant SaaS platform (super-admin + tenant admin model) for code-fixing, project management and order workflows. The logo in this package was produced by a professional designer to represent the product’s premium, reliable and technical brand identity.

---

## Contents (typical)
Extract the provided `Logo-Codefixxer.zip` to see all files. Typical included files:

- `Codefixxer-master.ai` — Adobe Illustrator master (vector, layered).
- `Codefixxer-logo.svg` — primary scalable vector for web.
- `Codefixxer-logo-mark.svg` — mark-only variant (icon).
- `Codefixxer-logo-horizontal.svg` — horizontal lockup.
- `Codefixxer-logo-vertical.svg` — stacked lockup.
- `Codefixxer-logo.png` — high-res transparent PNG.
- `Codefixxer-logo@2x.png`, `Codefixxer-logo@3x.png` — retina exports.
- `Codefixxer-favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `favicon-16.png` — favicons.
- `Codefixxer-white.png`, `Codefixxer-bw.png` — reversed & monochrome.
- `EPS/` and `PDF/` exports for print.
- `brand-colors.md` — hex/RGB tokens and usage.
- `typography.md` — recommended typefaces and fallbacks.
- `README.md` — this file.
- `CREDITS.md` and optionally `LICENSE` (if provided).

## Brand purpose & visual intent
The Codefixxer logo is designed to be:
- **Technical & trustworthy:** geometric mark and clear type that read well at small sizes.
- **SaaS-appropriate:** works in dashboards, favicons, app icons and marketing.
- **Premium & modern:** refined spacing, balanced negative space, and strong legibility.
- **Flexible:** includes mark-only, horizontal, vertical and monochrome versions for different backgrounds.

Use the master `.ai` as the single source of truth. Other files are derived exports.

---

## Color palette (example tokens)
Use the `brand-colors.md` file in the package for exact hex values. Example CSS tokens (replace with provided hex codes):

```css
:root{
  --codefx-primary: #0A6EFF;   /* primary blue */
  --codefx-accent:  #00D3A9;   /* accent / CTA */
  --codefx-dark:    #0D1B2A;
  --codefx-light:   #FFFFFF;
}
````

## Typography

Designer-provided headline and UI fonts should be used where licensed. If a paid font is provided, install per license. Example fallback stack for web:

```css
font-family: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
```

---

## DOs & DON’Ts

**DO**

* Use SVG for web and logos in UI.
* Keep required clearspace around the mark (follow spacing grid in `brand-colors.md`).
* Use monochrome versions for constrained spaces and print as needed.
* Keep proportions and spacing intact.

**DON’T**

* Distort, stretch, rotate or recolor the logo outside the approved palette.
* Apply heavy drop shadows, glows, or raster filters that decrease legibility.
* Crop the mark too tightly — always preserve required padding.

---

## Web integration (recommended)

Use the SVG inline or as an `<img>`:

```html
<!-- Inline SVG or file reference -->
<img src="/assets/images/Codefixxer-logo.svg" alt="Codefixxer logo" class="logo" width="160" />

<!-- Favicons in head -->
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon-32.png" sizes="32x32" />
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon-16.png" sizes="16x16" />
```

Accessibility: always include `alt="Codefixxer logo"` and ensure color contrast for logo usage on UI backgrounds.

---

## Print & production

* Use EPS/PDF/AI for print. Ensure CMYK profile for printed materials.
* Request bleeds and crop marks from designer for large format printing.
* Export high-res PNG (300dpi) when raster is required.

---

## File naming & versioning

Adopt semantic naming and version tags:

* `Codefixxer-logo_v1.ai`
* `Codefixxer-logo_v1.1.svg`
* `CHANGELOG.md` for major brand updates.

---

## License & ownership

Confirm license terms with the designer:

* Typical arrangements: client owns usage rights; designer may retain portfolio rights.
* Add `LICENSE` if transfer of ownership or a usage license is included.

---

## How to edit the master file

* Adobe Illustrator (recommended) — preserves layers, type and vector shapes.
* Alternatives: Affinity Designer or Vectornator (may have compatibility differences).
* For web tweaks: export optimized SVG and edit with a text editor or SVGO.

---

## Developer checklist (ready-to-go)

1. Copy `Codefixxer-logo.svg` to `assets/images/`.
2. Add favicons to project root and reference them in `<head>`.
3. Add CSS variables from `brand-colors.md`.
4. Use `logo-mark.svg` for small UI badges and avatar placeholders.
5. Replace any placeholder logos in templates with the brand files and run visual QA across dark/light themes.

---

## Attribution & credits

* **Designer:** \[Designer name or agency — insert here].
* **Client:** Repository owner (client who commissioned the logo).

Add a `CREDITS.md` to acknowledge the designer if required.

---

## Changelog

* `v1.0` — Initial master `.ai` + SVG/PNG/EPS exports and brand tokens.
